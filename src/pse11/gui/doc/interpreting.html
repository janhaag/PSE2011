<title>Interpreting a Program</title>

<body>
<h1>Interpreting a Program</h1>
<p>Once a program is syntactically correct, it can be interpreted. This is done in 'run' mode or in 'single step' mode.</p>
<h2>Run</h2>
<p>When running a program with the 'Run' button, all of its statements will be executed in succession. The execution will stop if any assertion fails and the line and type of the assertion failure will be displayed. A running program can be stopped or paused at any time using the 'Stop' or 'Pause' button.</p>
<h2>Single Step</h2>
<p>When running a program with the 'Single Step button', only the next statement will be executed (which is the first statement in the main function if no program is being executed).</p>
<p>Note that every division and every array access will insert an additional invisible statement just before the statement in which a division or array access is used.</p>
<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
<p>Breakpoints provide an additional option to stop a running program. There are two types of breakpoints: global breakpoints and statement breakpoints.</p>
<h3>Global Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Global breakpoints can be added to a program by using the input on the right-hand side. To add a breakpoint, enter any expression that can be evaluated to a boolean.</p>
<p>Before any statement is executed, all global breakpoints are checked. If one of them is true, the program execution will pause.</p>
<h3>Statement Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Statement breakpoints can be added by double clicking on a line number to the left of a program's code. An active statement breakpoint will be represented by a blue circle at the line number.</p>
<p>During program execution, if a line with a breakpoint is executed, the program execution will pause before any execution of that line's statements.</p>
<h2>Parameters of the main function</h2>
<p>If the main functions has any parameters, a window will prompt for all values of these parameters before beginning an execution of the program.</p>
<p>If an incorrect value is entered, the default value for a variable will be used (which is 0 for integers and 'false' for booleans).</p>
<p>The value of an array must be written using curly brackets to descend through dimensions.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following input will create a 2 dimensional integer array:</p>
<div class="code">
{{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}
</div>
<h2>Random Test</h2>
<p>By using 'Run' - 'Random Test' in the menu bar, the program can be executed many times while giving different parameters to the main function.</p>
<p>For every integer parameter of the main function there will be lower and upper bounds of allowed values. During random testing, a value of that interval will be used for the variable.</p>
<p>Arrays will need an additional parameter specifying the array size. For multidimensional arrays, this is the size of every dimension.</p>
<p>All runned tests with the respective parameters and a result, where success is representing a run without any assertion failure, will be displayed in the 'Misc' tab.</p>
