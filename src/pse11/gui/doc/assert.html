<h1>Assert</h1>
<p>An assertion is a predicate that describes the current state of a program.</p>
<p>
If an assertion is encountered while running a program, the condition of that assertion will be checked.
If the condition is false, the program execution will halt; otherwise, the program execution will continue.
The condition of an assertion is an expression that is evaluated to a boolean, allowing the usage of quantified expressions.
