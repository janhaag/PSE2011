<h1>Assertion</h1>
<p>An assertion is a predicate that describes the current state of a program.</p>
<p>
If an assertion is encountered while running a program, the condition of that assertion will be checked.
If the condition is false, the program execution will halt; otherwise, the program execution will continue.
The condition of an assertion is an expression that is evaluated to a boolean, allowing the usage of quantified expressions. 
</p>
<p>
Assertions can additionally be added to functions and while-loops with the ensure keyword, resulting in a check once the execution of the function body or the loop body are finished. 
While-loops can contain an invariant, which is an assertion that is checked every time the loop body execution is finished.
Functions can contain assumes, which are checked on function body entry.
</p>
<p>
A program can only be proven correct if all assertions are true.
</p>
<h2>Axioms</h2>
Axioms are created by using the axiom keyword. Axioms are special assertions, as they are not checked at runtime and will not be proved, but instead be used to prove other assertions in the program.
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p class="code">
assert condition;
</p>
<p class="code">
type function(parameters) assume { condition; ... } {<br />
	<span class="code">function body</span><br />
} ensure { condition; ... }<br />
</p>
<p class="code">
while(loop condition) invariant { condition; ... } {<br />
	<span class="code">function body</span><br />
} ensure{ condition; ... }<br />
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p class="code">
int function(int x) assume x > 0 {<br />
<span class="code">int y = x + 1;</span><br />
} ensure y > 0;<br /> 
</p>
<p class="code">
int x = 4;<br />
assert exists y(3,6) y == x;
