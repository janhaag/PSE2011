<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Loading and Saving</h2>
<p>Any file with the extension 'txt' or 'wp' can be read and its content be placed into the editor with 'File' - 'Load'. The editor's content can be saved into a file with 'File' - 'Save'.</p>
<h2>Interpreting a Program</h2>
<p>A program with correct syntax can be interpreted, thus executing its statements. 
When interpreting a program, you can either run the program, which will only stop when a runtime error has occured, or execute the program in single-step mode, which will cause the interpretation to stop after every executed statement.</p> 
<h2>Verifying a Program</h2>
<p>A program with correct syntax can be verified. This is done using the theorem prover Z3 developed by Microsoft. A verification can result in the program being verified as correct, as incorrect or unknown. 
The verifier tries to use axioms in the program to conclude all assertions.</p> 
<h2>Syntax in this Documentation</h2>
<p>The syntax help has additional annotations using boxes:</p>
<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1em;"><span class="code_optional">optional</span> means that the syntax element in the box is optional</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1em;"><span class="code_optional">multiple and optional<span class="code_mult">*</span></span> means that the syntax element in the box is optional and can be repeated any number of times</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1em;"><span class="code_element">syntax element</span> means that the syntax element in the box is to be replaced by the syntax of another syntax element</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1em;"><span>text</span> without any further formatting means that the text is to be used without modification</li>
</ul>
