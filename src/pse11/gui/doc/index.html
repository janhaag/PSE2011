<h2>Interpreting a Program</h2>
<p>A program with correct syntax can be interpreted, thus executing its statements. 
When interpreting a program, you can either run the program, which will only stop when a runtime error has occured, or execute the program in single-step mode, which will cause the interpretation to stop after every executed statement.</p> 
<h2>Verifying a Program</h2>
<p>A program with correct syntax can be verified. This is done using the theorem prover Z3 developed by Microsoft. A verification can result in the program being verified as correct, as incorrect or unknown. 
The verifier tries to use axioms in the program to conclude all assertions.</p>
