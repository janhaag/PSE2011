<h1>While-Loop</h1>
<p>A while-Loop is control flow statement. 
The statement block following the while-statement is only executed if a specified condition is true. 
If the condition is true after leaving that statement block, the statement block is entered again. 
If the condition is false when encountering a while-statement during execution or after leaving the statement block after a 
while-statement, the execution continues after that statement block. 
A while-loop can be extended by the assertion statements <span class="code">invariant</span> and <span class="code">ensure</span>, which are optional. See the article about assertions for further information.
