<h1>Specification</h1>
<p>A specification is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>assert</li>
	<li>assume</li>
	<li>ensure</li>
	<li>invariant</li>
	<li>axiom</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interpreting</h2>
<p>When interpreting a progam, all specifications that are encountered during execution (with the exception of axioms) will be checked.
If a specification fails, the program execution will stop; otherwise, the execution will continue as normal.</p>
<h2>Validating</h2>
<p>When validating a program, specifications (with the exception of axioms and assumes) are used to generate proof obligations.
Axioms and assumes will be used to proof other specifications.</p>
